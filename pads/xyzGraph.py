"""xyzGraph.py

An xyz graph is the graph formed by a set of points in R^3 such that any
axis-parallel line intersects the set in zero or two points; we add an edge
for the two points on any nonempty line. These graphs include all bipartite
simple polyhedra, as well as some other nonplanar graphs; see
http://11011110.livejournal.com/tag/xyz+graphs for more.

We implement here an exponential-time algorithm for finding such
representations of an arbitrary graph, when they exist.
