"""StrongConnectivity.py

DFS-based algorithm for computing strongly connected components.

If G is a graph, then
- StronglyConnectedComponents(G) returns a list of
  its components, each represented as a subgraph of G
- Condensation(G) returns a directed acyclic graph, the
  vertices of which are strongly connected components of G.
  Each vertex of the condensation is represented as a frozenset
  of the vertices of G within a single strongly connected component.
